        <p class="paragraph">
        SAMVEG, the student society associated with the department of Mechanical Engineering, was formed on 1st March, 2006 under the guidance of Mr. Pallab Biswas and with the relentless support of the then third year students of the Mechanical Engineering Department. The society is formed with an aim to provide a platform to the students on which they enhance their practical knowledge and gain valuable experience in the industrial arena.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">
        Samveg Society aims to help students turn their imagination into an engineering reality and supports all the imagination processes through creative events from its inception to final creation. Samveg acts as a platform for all mechanical students to show their technical and managerial skills and improve on them. Students of the college are offered opportunities such as quizzing, debating, group discussions, industrial visits, technical conferences and various technical events. Samveg has actively participated as a society in various Technical Festivals over the years. The sole intention behind starting off with a department society was to provide a channelized growth medium to the students, not merely in the field of academics, but also for other extra-curricular activities.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">In 2016-17, Students of SAMVEG Society were actively involved in organizing and coordination of society activities. The Samveg students organized the events QUADMANIA, QUIZENE and AUTOCAD TRAINING during the academic year. SAMVEG students of Mechanical Engineering department were actively involved in organizing and coordination of society activities. The Samveg students have organized the events ROBOTRIX 17 on 11-12 Feb 2017 and BLITZKRIEG on 5-6 Apr 2017 during even semester 2017-18.</p>
